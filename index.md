## Introduction

This styleguide is compiled from various styleguides (referenced in their respective modules). This is not necessarily a hard rule to follow, it is more of a guide on how to be more consistent as a company and to make it easier for everyone to understand each other's code. It can be modified by anyone, but of course, if there is a modification, either modify it as a pull request or directly(if you have access). Upon modifying successfully, please inform all other team members of the change or addition so everyone will be on the same page.

Some of the style listed here are opinionated and some are proven facts.
